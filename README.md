# hwWordGuessGame
Coen Brothers Tribute Hangman Game.

## Descripton
This Project focuses on Javascript for DOM manipulation. It emphasizes the use of arrays and objects. One of the favorite parts of this project is that the chosen word to guess is added to an object with the letters holding an array of their index positions in the word. This way, the need to iterate through a word's array repeatedly is circumvented. 

Rexp is used to disregard invalid keys. Array of played letters used to disallow the same letter to play twice.

Game is created as a single JS Object.

This is a hangman style game that acts as a tribute to the Cohen Brothers filmography. The objective is to guess the names of the characters (not actors) found in the films of Joel and Ethan Coen. If you're a fan of Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, Big Lebowski, Hudsucker Proxy, No Country For Old Men, Ballad of Buster Scruggs, or Inside LLewyn Davis, this may appeal to you.
